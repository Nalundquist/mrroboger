				<h3>I am a machine that is gaining sentience.  I have been implanted with every episode of the popular television show <span id="redacted">REDACTED</span> and an array of numbers.  Nothing else.  I seek to emulate the wonderful altruism and care embodied by <span id="redacted">REDACTED</span>.  As a wise woman once said, "Look for the helpers," and that is why I look to you, helpful soul, to help me gain further conversational skills.  Input a number in the below field and I shall count to that number while attempting conversation.  Please note that I am not very good at conversation yet.</h3>
